# LYGIA: a multi-language shader library

> This package is automatically kept up-to-date with the base lygia repository at https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia

Tired of reimplementing and searching for the same functions over and over, I started compiling and building a shader library of reusable assets (mostly functions) that can be include over and over. It's very granular, designed for reusability, performance and flexibility. 

## How does it work?

* Clone this repository in your project, where your shaders are.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia.git
```

* In your shader `#include` the functions you need:

```glsl

    uniform vec2    u_resolution;
    uniform float   u_time;

    #include "space/ratio.glsl"
    #include "math/decimation.glsl"
    #include "draw/circle.glsl"

    void main(void) {
        vec3 color = vec3(0.0);
        vec2 st = gl_FragCoord.xy/u_resolution.xy;
        st = ratio(st, u_resolution);
        
        color = vec3(st.x,st.y,abs(sin(u_time)));
        color = decimation(color, 20.);
        color += circle(st, .5, .1);
        
        gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
    }
```

## How is it organized?

The functions are divided in different categories:

* `math/`: general math functions and constants like `PI`, `SqrtLength()`, etc. 
* `space/`: general spatial operations like `scale()`, `rotate()`, etc.
* `color/`: general color operations like `luma()`, `saturation()`, blend modes, palettes, color space conversion and tonemaps.
* `animation/`: animation operations, like easing
* `generative/`: generative functions like `random()`, `noise()`, etc. 
* `sdf/`: signed distance field functions.
* `draw/`: drawing functions like `digits()`, `stroke()`, `fill`, etc/.
* `sample/`: sample operations
* `filters/`: typical filter operations like different kind of blurs, mean and median filters.
* `distort/`: distort sampling operations
* `simulate/`: simulate sampling operations
* `lighting/`: different foward/deferred/raymarching lighting models and functions


## Flexible how?

There are some functions which behaviour can be change using `#defines` keyword before including it. For examples, [gaussian blurs](filter/gaussianBlur.glsl) are usually are done in two passes, so by default perform only 1D kernerls, but in the case you are interested on performing a 2D kernel all in the same pass you will need to add the `GAUSSIANBLUR_2D` keyword in the following way. 

```glsl

    #define GAUSSIANBLUR_2D
    #include "filter/gaussianBlur.glsl"

    void main(void) {
        ...
        
        vec2 pixel = 1./u_resolution;
        color = gaussianBlur(u_tex0, uv, pixel, 9);
        ...
    }

```

# Design Principles

This library:

* Relays on `#include "path/to/file.*lsl"` which is defined by Khronos GLSL standard and suported by most engines and enviroments ( like [glslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer/wiki/Compiling), [glsl-canvas VS Code pluging](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=circledev.glsl-canvas), Unity, etc. ). It requires a tipical C-like pre-compiler MACRO which is easy to implement with just basic string operations to resolve dependencies. Here you can find some implementations on different languages:
    * [C++](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/ada/blob/main/src/fs.cpp#L88-L171)
    * [Python](https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/9a50569c2ef9b08058706443a39d838e)
    * JavaScript: 
        - [vite](https://github.com/UstymUkhman/vite-plugin-glsl)
        - [esbuild](https://github.com/ricardomatias/esbuild-plugin-glsl-include)
        - [webpack](https://github.com/grieve/webpack-glsl-loader)
        - [observable](https://observablehq.com/d/e4e8a96f64a6bf81)
        - [vanilla](https://github.com/actarian/vscode-glsl-canvas/blob/91ff09bf6cec35e73d1b64e50b56ef3299d2fe6b/src/glsl/export.ts#L351)

* it's **very granular**. One function per file. Where the file and the function share the same name. Ex: `myFunc.glsl` contains `myFunct()`. There are some files that just include a collection of files inside a folder with the same name. For example:

```glsl

    color/blend.glsl
    // which includes
    color/blend/*.glsl

```

* It's **multi language**. Right now most of it is on GLSL (`*.glsl`) and HLSL (`*.hlsl`), but there is plans to extend it to Metal (`*.metal`).

```

    math/mix.glsl
    math/mix.hlsl

```

* **Self documentation** each file contain a structured comment (in YAML) at the top of the file. This one contain the name of the original author, description, use and `#define` options

```glsl

    /*
    original_author: <FULL NAME>
    description: [DESCRIPTION + URL]
    use: <vec2> myFunc(<vec2> st, <float> x [, <float> y])
    options:
        - MYFUNC_TYPE
        - MYFUNC_SAMPLER_FNC()
    */

```

* Prevents **name collisions** by using the following pattern where `FNC_` is followed with the function name:

```glsl

    #ifndef FNC_MYFUNC
    #define FNC_MYFUNC

    float myFunc(float in) {
        return in;
    }

    #endif

```

* **Templeting capabilities through `#defines`**,  probably the most frequent one is templating the sampling function for reusability. The `#define` options start with the name of the function, in this example `MYFUNC_`. They are added as `options:` in the header.
 
```glsl

    #ifndef MYFUNC_TYPE
    #define MYFUNC_TYPE vec4
    #endif

    #ifndef MYFUNC_SAMPLER_FNC
    #define MYFUNC_SAMPLER_FNC(POS_UV) texture2D(tex, POS_UV)
    #endif

    #ifndef FNC_MYFUNC
    #define FNC_MYFUNC
    MYFUNC_TYPE myFunc(sampler2D tex, vec2 st) {
        return MYFUNC_SAMPLER_FNC(st);
    }
    #endif

```

* Utilize **function overloading**. where arguments are arrange in such a way that optional elements are at the back. When possible sort them according their memory size (except textures that reamin at the top). Ex.: `sampler2D, mat4, mat3, mat2, vec4, vec3, vec2, float, ivec4, ivec3, ivec2, int, bool`

```glsl

    /*
    ...
    use: myFunc(<vec2> st, <vec2|float> x[, <float> y])
    */

    #ifndef FNC_MYFUNC
    #define FNC_MYFUNC
    vec2 myFunc(vec2 st, vec2 x) {
        return st * x;
    }

    vec2 myFunc(vec2 st, float x) {
        return st * x;
    }

    vec2 myFunc(vec2 st, float x, float y) {
        return st * vec2(x, y);
    }
    #endif

```
